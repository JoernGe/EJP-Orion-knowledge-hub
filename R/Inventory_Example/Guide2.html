</ul>
<p>The tables are designed to give an overview of the surveillance systems in different sectors (Public health, animal health, feed &amp; food). and different EU member states. They include information on the Hazard (infectious agent or the relevant disease), as well as information on the target species (or products), purpose of the surveillance system, sampling approach, sample types etc. The app provides easy functions to search within sectors and across sectors.</p>
<p>Data collection into the inventories is an ongoing and updatable process to keep the information relevant and useful. Data are systematically collected through the use of data collection templates designed in Excel. Initially, ORION partners were asked to fill in the templates for their country and sector.</p>
<p>However, this inventory is open for any country to provide contributions. If you would like to contribute, please download the Excel collection sheets (link below) as well as the instructions to fill in the sheet, and fill in your data. Send the Excel sheet to <a href="mailto:EJP.Orion@fli.de" class="email">EJP.Orion@fli.de</a> </p>
