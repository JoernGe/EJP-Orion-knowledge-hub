## Inventories on public health surveillance, animal health surveillance, feed & food and literature
The ORION project aims at establishing and strengthening inter-institutional collaboration and transdisciplinary knowledge transfer in the area of surveillance data integration and interpretation, along the One Health (OH) objective of improving health and wellbeing. This will be achieved through an interdisciplinary collaboration of 13 veterinary and/or public health institutes from 7 European countries. These agencies are committed to adopt best practice One Health Surveillance (OHS) solutions (guidelines, methods, tools and knowledge). Specifically this project will create:
- an OH Surveillance Codex - The OHS Codex aims at establishing a high-level framework that supports mutual understanding and information exchange between OHS sectors, which are requisite for integrated OHS data analyses. To bring this framework into “action”, the OHS Codex postulates a set of four high-level principles as well as a description of resources (e.g. tools, technical solutions, guidance documents) and example implementations supporting the adoption of each OHS Codex principles.
- an OHS Knowledge Base - A cross-domain inventory of currently available data sources, methods / algorithms / tools, that support One Health surveillance data generation, data analysis, modelling and decision Support. The Input is the combined efforts of the One Health knowledge bases EPI, Integration and NGS
- an OHEJP Glossary - The glossary is a joint effort between JIP ORION, JIP COHESIVE and JRP NOVA. The OHEJP Glossary has 3 main functionalities. First the collection of One Health (OH) related terms and definitions in the sectors public health, animal health and food safety. Second, highlighting similarities and differences of terms and definitions between the sectors. Finally an infrastructure to reference, search and filter terms and definitions. https://aginfra.d4science.org/web/orionknowledgehub/catalogue

## Shiny App
The code will create a shiny app to explore the different inventories.   
With this example code you can create an example app to create inventories on public health, animal heatlth and feed and food surveillance systems.  
You can run the app by using the following commands in RStudio:
```
library(shiny)
runGitHub("EJP-Orion-knowledge-hub", "JoernGe", subdir = "/R/Inventory_Example/")
```
In this example app we did not include the logo of FLI or the project and the number of surveillance systems is limited.

You can find the full app at: https://shiny.fli.de/ife-apps/EJPOrion_WP2Epi/

**Abstract:** Cross-sector communication, collaboration and knowledge exchange are still significant challenges for practical adoption of the One Health paradigm. To address these needs the “One Health Surveillance Codex” (OHS Codex) was established to provide a framework for the One Health community to continuously share practical solutions (e.g. tools, technical resources, guidance documents and experiences) applicable for national and international stakeholders from different One Health Surveillance sectors. Currently, the OHS Codex provides a number of resources that support the adoption of the OH paradigm in areas linked to the harmonization and interpretation of surveillance data. The OHS Codex framework comprises four high-level “action” principles, which respectively support collaboration, knowledge exchange, data interoperability, and dissemination. These principles match well with priority areas identified in the “Tripartite Guide to Addressing Zoonotic Diseases in Countries” published by WHO, FAO and OIE. Within each of the four principles, the OHS Codex provides a collection of useful resources as well as pointers to success stories for the application of these resources. As the OHS Codex is designed as an open community framework, it will continuously evolve and adapt to the needs of the OH community in the future.
